## Title
Put Deep Learning to work: Accelerate Deep Learning through Amazon SageMaker and ML Services

## Abstract
Deploying deep learning (DL) projects are becoming increasingly more pervasive at enterprises and startups alike. At Amazon, Machine Learning University (MLU)-trained engineers are taking DL to every aspect of Amazon’s businesses, beyond just Amazon Go, Alexa, and Robotics.
In this workshop, Wenming Ye (AWS), Rachel Hu (AWS), and Miro Enev (Nvidia) offer a practical next step in DL learning with instructions, and hands-on labs using the latest Nvidia GPUs and AWS Inferentia. You will explore the current trends powering AI/DL adoption, powerful new GPU/AWS Inferentia accelerator instances, distributed training and inference optimization in neural networks.
